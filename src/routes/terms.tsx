        Welcome to SurplusLink. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the

        To the maximum extent permitted by law, SurplusLink disclaims any and all liability for illness,
        injury, or damages arising from the consumption or handling of food donated through the platform.
        Donors and NGOs engage in transactions at their own risk.

        notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation,
        including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
