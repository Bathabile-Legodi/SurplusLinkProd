      <p>
        This Cookie Policy explains how SurplusLink ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar
        technologies to recognize you when you visit our platform. It explains what these technologies are
        and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
      </p>

      <h2>1. What are cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a
        website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work
        more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Why do we use cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        We use first-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in
        order for our platform to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary"
        cookies. For example, we use cookies to keep you logged in securely.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Authentication & Session Cookies:</strong> We use Supabase to manage user sessions.
          Tokens and session identifiers are stored in cookies (or local storage) to keep you securely logged
          in as you navigate between pages. These are strictly necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>UI State Cookies:</strong> We may store small preferences (like your dark/light mode preference
          or sidebar collapse state) to prevent flashing during server-side rendering.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. What about tracking and third-party cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        SurplusLink is committed to privacy. We do not use intrusive third-party tracking cookies or advertising
        networks. Any third-party scripts (such as Google Maps) are used strictly for functionality (e.g., location autocomplete)
        and do not track you for advertising purposes on our behalf.
      </p>

      <h2>5. How can I control cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. Because the cookies we use are strictly
        necessary to deliver the platform to you, you cannot refuse them without breaking core functionality (such as logging in).
        You can, however, block or delete them by changing your browser settings, but you will not be able to use the authenticated
        features of SurplusLink.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Updates to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use
        or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed.
